 In WODs 3.1-3.3, I worked on creating and customizing a website. I found that the easiest way to produce the WODs was to take notes and do research on what needs to be discussed before recording the video. For example, in future WODs that are more complex, creating a simple outline of what to say and do will make the WOD flow better. In earlier, less successful recordings, I found difficulty in not being able to pause the recording when I got stuck on a certain concept. To remedy this, I will try using new software that allows for easily pausing the recording.
