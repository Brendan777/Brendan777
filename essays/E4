1. My programming skills improved in understanding and interpreting different types of code. For this assignment I learned the different ways that js, json, and html files work together

2. I need to look at more of the lectures and other online resources to improve my understanding of coding.

3. I feel that I am not at the point to do the WOD's without the screencast. I think I need to spend more time understanding coding concepts. 

4. The labs have helped me gain a basic understanding of how coding works. I feel that since the class is a bit fast paced I have had difficulty applying the concepts we learned. 

5. I learned a lot about how long these assignments will take. I will put more time aside to understand and finish assignment 2. 

6. I think the class could go at a slower pace to learn certain concepts. 

7. The screenscasts helped me understand the concepts that we were going over
