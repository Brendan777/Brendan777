In this WOD I altered the SmartPhoneProducts1 html. The objective of this WOD was an intro into using Javascript to alter HTML instead of hard coding it into the HTML which could easily result in errors. In this WOD I had difficulty as I didnâ€™t carefully watch the lectures or review alot of the concepts used. After restarting a few times and reviewing the information for the lab I was able complete the assignment. Something that I did differently in this WOD was pause the recording perform the action, then explain briefly what this action was and how it impacted the code. This helped redyuce deadtime in the video. For the next video, I will try to look at the WOD then review the lecture so I can take not of things that are important for the assignment.
